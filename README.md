# ðŸ’© Metabolism Plugin ðŸ’©

### A Silly Minecraft Spigot Plugin

## Overview

If you're looking for a plugin to add a touch of bathroom humor to your server, look no further!

## Features

- **Guts Simulation**: The plugin tracks the "guts" level of players, because why not?
- **Broadcast Poop Events**: When a player's guts are full, the server broadcasts that they've "pooped their pants" to everyone.
- **Brown Carpet Surprise**: As an extra twist, it changes the block under the player to BROWN_CARPET to really drive the point home.

## Installation

1. Download the Metabolism Plugin JAR file from the [releases](https://github.com/arnemileswinter/mc-metabolism/releases) page.
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your Minecraft server.

That's it! Your server is now ready for some lighthearted fun.

## Usage

- The plugin will automatically start simulating players' guts as they log in.
- As the guts level reaches 100%, players will receive a broadcast message about their "accident."
- The block beneath them will change to BROWN_CARPET for added comedic effect.
- To uninstall, simply remove the plugin JAR from your server's `plugins` folder and restart.
